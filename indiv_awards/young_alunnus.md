# Ellison Onizuka Young Alumnus Award

The Ellison Onizuka Young Alumnus Award is made to members of Triangle within twenty years of their initiation in acknowledgement of their having received outstanding honorable recognition in 
such fields as engineering, architecture, science, education, industry, government, and the like, and by virtue of this having enhanced the prestige of Triangle. The recipient receives a certificate signed by the National President and the National Secretary. 

The award is named after Ellison S. Onizuka colo69, who flew on the space shuttle Discovery in January 1985 and lost his life in the Challenger accident in January 1986.
