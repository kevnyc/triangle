Caspar Ferdinand "Cap" Henning ill16, the namesake of this honor,  washed dishes in order to attend the University of Illinois his freshman year.  The following year (1916), with an assist from home, he joined Triangle Fraternity.  After graduation, Cap worked for a Chicago consulting firm, and in 1923, registered at the Moody Bible Institute where he graduated four years later.  He moved careers to the Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company where he worked as a mechanical engineer. When he retired from Manufacturers Mutual in 1965 he was the vice president of the company. Before he retired, Cap worked at his office during the day, then after hours at the Pacific Garden Mission and Gideons International. The Mission served as a shelter in a rough section of Chicago.  Cap served those who attended the shelter - some homeless, some women and children, some seeking refuge because of family troubles - by giving them something to eat for free, provided a clean bed, and a fresh change of clothing.  While at the Mission, Cap ministered to the bodies, minds, and souls of those who sought shelter.  He quickly advanced to the board of Pacific Garden Mission.  Prior to his death, Cap served as Chairman of the board of the Mission and devoted his career to serving those in need.
