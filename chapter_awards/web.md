# Frederick R.  Kappel Web Communications Award (1996-2016)

The Frederick R.  Kappel Web Communications
Award was created by National Council to recognize that current
technology is an important part of our lives as Triangles.  With the
advent of the World Wide Web, many chapters are creating a presence in the
form of a home page.  These pages are extremely creative and the National
Organization wanted to recognize the hard work that goes into creating and
maintaining them.

Each chapter's page was judged on three general criteria: content,
aesthetics, and technical merit.
