# Campus Involvement Award

An integral part of being Greek is recognizing our ability to affect change within the community in which we live. By choosing to become involved in activities outside of our regular chapter activities we are doing our part to strengthen the community, the campus, and the positive image of Greeks as contributors to the betterment of our community.

From 2007 to 2016, awards were presented to chapters whose members were involved in an average of two or more campus organizations outside of Triangle. Organizations can include but are not limited to: engineering student councils, resident advisors, ASME, ASCE, Solar Car Club, etc.

Beginning in 2017, awards were presented to one or more chapters who excelled in campus involvement.
