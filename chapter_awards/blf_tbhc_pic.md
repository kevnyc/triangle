#  BLF/TBHC Property Improvement Contest

The Triangle Building &amp; Housing Corporation (TBHC) Improvement Contest is designed to encourage our undergraduate Triangle chapters and members to enhance their fraternity property or a local community property in a substantial and beneficial way through physical improvement.

From 2012 through 2016, awards were given for Best Interior Project, Best Exterior Project, Best "Green" Project, and Best Community Project. In 2017, the individual categories were eliminated.
