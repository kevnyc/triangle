# Publications Awards

To encourage improvement in quality and frequency of chapter letters and
to recognize excellence in communications with alumni, Publications Awards
trophies in two divisions--Mimeographed and Printed--were given to
Triangle by Herbert F.  Scobie minn32, former executive director and
TRIANGLE REVIEW editor.  First of the annual presentations were made at
the 1970 Convention.  The Mimeographed Division was changed to the
Duplicated Division in 1981.
