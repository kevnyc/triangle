# Alumni Relations Plaque (1932-1999)

Recipients of the Triangle Service Key, in 1932, presented National
Council with a plaque to be awarded each year to the active organization
which had done the most during the preceding year to promote close
relations with its alumni.  A small engraved shield was added for each
winner, and when the first trophy was filled a second was purchased by the
Service Key holders.  The award, last presented in 1959, was reactivated
in 1982.
