# Kahlert Outstanding Academic Excellence Awards

As with most fraternal organizations, academic achievement serves as a core value and founding principle of Triangle Fraternity and should be a primary focus for both the chapter and the individual. While it is acknowledged that Triangle active chapters have a myriad of membership responsibilities it is important to recognize the most important responsibility to not only Triangle, but to self, chapter, and community: academics.

The Triangle Education Foundation with the generous support of the Kahlert Foundation will recognize chapter's academic achievements annually in two categories: Outstanding Academic Excellence (Highest GPA), and Most Improved Academic Excellence.
