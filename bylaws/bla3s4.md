# ARTICLE 3 - OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES

## SECTION 4 - ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND NATIONAL COUNCIL

### Para. 1

Each year, the President and Vice President shall be elected for a 
one-year term and three members of National Council shall be elected for 
two-year terms.  If the President or Vice President is nominated from a 
class of National Council members whose term is not expiring, the 
nominating committee shall nominate a man for election to fill the 
unexpired term.

### Para. 2

Election of the President, Vice President and other members of National Council shall be by popular vote of all initiates, who shall be informed of the nominees and their qualifications and provided with a ballot by March 1. The ballot shall be posted on the Fraternity website and distributed via email to the membership. National Council may use other media to publicize the ballot. The ballot shall include the names of the nominees and space for a write-in candidate for the offices of President, Vice President and each National Council position to be filled.  To be counted, ballots must reach the National Office within thirty (30) days from the posting on the Fraternity website.

### Para. 3

For purposes of determining eligibility for nomination, election or 
appointment, the following shall apply:

<ol type="a">
<li>The one year service requirement as President or Vice President and the three year service requirement as a member of National Council, in order to be eligible for nomination and election as President, shall be determined as of the time the President is to take office.  The requirement shall not apply to the succession of the Vice President to the presidency in the event of a vacancy in that office.
</li>
<li>The one year service requirement as a member of National Council, in 
order to be eligible for nomination and election as Vice President, shall 
be determined as of the time the Vice President is to take office.  The 
requirement shall apply to the selection of a Vice President in the event 
of a vacancy in that office.
</li>
<li>Service for six months or more of a term shall constitute a year for purposes of determining eligibility for election or appointment.
</li>
<li>A member is ineligible for election or appointment to National Council if the member has served for the past ten (10) years in succession on National Council. This restriction does not apply to offices determined through automatic succession (e.g., President transition to Past President).
</li>
<li>A member is ineligible to serve on National Council if the member has an official role at the national level (e.g., Triangle Education Foundation, Triangle Building and Housing Corporation), with a chapter (e.g., Active or Alumni Organization officer, Chapter Housing Board, Faculty Advisor, Chapter Advisor), or with an Alumni Association.
</li>
<li>A member is ineligible for nomination to National Council if the member is serving on the current Nominating Committee.
</li>
</ol>

### Para. 4

If a candidate for elected office withdraws his candidacy or enters Chapter Eternal after the ballots have been printed and before the election has closed, National Council shall make a reasonable effort to inform chapters and members that the member in question is no longer a candidate. TRIANGLE members will be permitted to submit amended ballots. If more than one ballot is received from a member, the one with the later date, as determined by the printed postal cancellation or electronic timestamp, shall be counted.

### Para. 5

Following the close of the election, if the candidate receiving the most votes for an office is unable or unwilling to serve, National Council shall fill the vacancy in the manner specified in these Bylaws.
