constitution, bylaws and/or fraternity regulations which shall contain 
nothing inconsistent with National Constitution, Bylaws, or Fraternity

in the Ritual.  An amendment to the National documents shall immediately 
render void and inoperative any contrary section or clause in any chapter 
governing document.
