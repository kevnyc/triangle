full-time study.</li>

<li>A man may be pledged only if his cumulative grade point average is at least 2.5 on a 4.00 scale or, if he has not completed the first term of the freshman year, if his high school cumulative grade point average is at least 2.5 on a 4.00 scale or equivalent.

</ol>

### Para. 2 - Recruitment and Pledging

<ol type="a">
<li>Any member of TRIANGLE may suggest the name of a man for
consideration for membership in the Fraternity.</li>

<li>A recruitment committee or team shall make proper and convenient
arrangements to entertain and/or interview prospective members in
an informal way to enable as many of the active members as
practicable to become acquainted with the prospective member and
to enable him to become acquainted with the membership of the
chapter.</li>

<li><p>After the name of a prospective member has been suggested,
and as soon as sufficient information is available, his
suitability for membership shall be discussed.</p>

<p>After the discussion, any active member may propose him as a
candidate.  The vote upon each individual
prospective member shall be conducted by secret ballot in a
regular meeting or in a special meeting of the active
organization (or recruitment team, if provided by the chapter
constitution) that has been previously announced to the active
members of the chapter.</p>

<p>Each active member of the chapter shall indicate his favorable
vote by casting a white ball in the ballot box, or his
unfavorable vote by casting a black cube; but every active member
of the chapter shall have the opportunity to vote on each
prospective member.  However, by provision of its constitution,
an active organization may use any other method of determining
the eligibility of a potential candidate.</p>

<p>A prospective member shall be selected as a candidate unless three
or more unfavorable votes are cast; however any chapter may by
provision of its constitution change the number of such
unfavorable votes.</p>
</li>

<li>The invitation to a prospective member shall be extended as
soon as possible after his election has been announced.  The
prospective member shall be allowed ample time to privately
consider the invitation of the Fraternity. No attempt shall be
made to urge him to make an immediate decision.  However, the
invitation shall not be extended beyond a reasonable period of
time.</li>

<li>Having voluntarily stated his acceptance of the invitation to
become a candidate in TRIANGLE, the prospective member shall be promptly
pledged in a ceremony which shall include the administration of
the candidate oath before two or more members of the chapter.  The

administer the candidate oath as follows:

<blockquote>

"Mr. __________(state full name), please raise your
right hand and repeat these words after me:

<br><br>

I solemnly swear (or affirm) upon my word and honor as a
gentleman that I will become a member of ____________ Chapter of
TRIANGLE at such time as it may prescribe, and that I will follow
to the best of my ability any directions regarding my actions
which TRIANGLE may offer, and that I will so conduct myself as to
warrant the respect and esteem of my fellow men. I promise to in
no way make intelligible to others any of the secrets of TRIANGLE
that may become known to me."

</blockquote>
</li>

<li>The president or his designee shall then affix the candidate pin to the coat lapel or shirt or sweater of the candidate, telling him that he is expected to wear it in an appropriate manner until initiated.</li>

organization shall forward to the National Office a Notice of
