## SECTION 6 - RELEASE OF CANDIDATES AND MEMBERS

### Para. 1 - Release of Candidates

A candidate shall be released:

<ol type="a">
<li>if he has not been initiated within one calendar year after
pledging;</li>
<li>if he withdraws from school or if he fails to return for
school for any regular term during his candidacy;</li>
<li>if he becomes ineligible for membership by reason of not
being enrolled in an approved curriculum as specified in these
Bylaws;</li>
<li>upon his own request, after the president and vice president
of the active organization have discussed the matter with him and
have clearly determined his reasons for the request;</li>
<li>if, at any time, it is found that he was ineligible to become
a candidate at the time of his pledging, according to the
requirements of these Bylaws and of the National Constitution;</li>
<li>if he enters into any negotiations for securing membership in
any other national academic college fraternity;</li>
<li>if he evidences unwillingness to conform to the directions
given for preparation for initiation;</li>
<li>if he refuses to complete or to regard seriously the various
steps in the initiation; or;</li>
<li>upon the majority vote of the active organization taken not
less than two weeks subsequent to such a proposal at an active
organization meeting.</li>
</ol>

### Para. 2 - Suspension and Expulsion of Members

<ol type="a">
<li><p>A member of an active organization may be suspended or 
expelled by three-fourths (3/4) vote of the active organization 
of the chapter, excepting the vote of the man or men in question. 
A suspension must have a defined period which may not exceed one 
year. If the meeting is a regularly scheduled meeting, the
votes of the members who are absent shall be cast with the
majority of those present and eligible to vote.  Proxy votes
shall not be permitted.  All voting members shall be given notice
at least one week in advance of the meeting that a question of
suspension or expulsion is to be considered.  Members for whom
suspension or expulsion is to be considered shall be informed in
advance and in writing of the basis of such action.  Meetings
specially convened to consider suspension or expulsion should be
avoided, but if such a meeting is necessary and called, notice
shall be served to all voting members and the members for whom
the suspension or expulsion is to be considered.  Suspension of
an active member shall not relieve the active organization of the
responsibility to pay the National Active Fee with respect to the
suspended member.</p>

<p>An active member may request, in writing, suspension for hardship
reasons.  Requests for suspension in excess of one year cannot be
considered, but a renewal of suspension can be considered upon
written request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An alumni, associate, chapter honorary member, or
distinguished fellow may be suspended or expelled following
action on a petition by any alumni or associate member.  The
elected officers of the chapter (officers in the active and alumni 
organizations) must act on the petition within
30 days of its receipt.  In case the majority of officers are in
favor of suspension or expulsion, the member is suspended until
the next regular or special meeting of the chapter.  The man so suspended
shall be so notified, and he shall be given not less than 30 days
written notice of the time and place of the next regular or special chapter
meeting. The time and place of this meeting will be determined and agreed 
to by the active president and alumni president.</p>

<p>When an alumni, associate, chapter honorary member, or
distinguished fellow has been suspended by action of the chapter
officers as prescribed above, he may be expelled by a vote of
three-fourths (3/4) of the members (other than the man suspended)
present at the next regular or special chapter meeting, provided
there are at least 25 members present, including 12 alumni or
associate members.  Upon failure of the vote to expel, a majority
vote shall decide on further suspension or reinstatement. A
member may be considered "present" at the meeting via conference 
telephone or other communications equipment as long as they can 
communicate with all persons participating in the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A member of TRIANGLE may be suspended or expelled by National
Council.  The member and, in the
case of active, alumni, associate, or chapter honorary members,
his chapter (both the active organization and the alumni
organization) shall be given written notice of the charges and
the time and place of the next regular meeting of National
Council at which the member will be given a hearing.  Such notice
shall be delivered at least ten (10) days prior to the
scheduled hearing. Suspension shall be by a two-thirds (2/3) vote
of National Council, and expulsion shall be by unanimous vote of
National Council.</p>

<p>Within fifteen (15) days following suspension or expulsion by 
National Council, the National President shall appoint an appeals 
board consisting of the three most recent Past National Presidents 
who are not currently serving on National Council and who are able 
and willing to serve. This board shall examine the charges against 
the member and shall vote on the member's continued suspension or 
expulsion. A majority vote of the appeals board is required to 
sustain the decision by National Council.</p>
</li>
<li>A member who is suspended shall cease all fraternal
activities of TRIANGLE during the period of suspension; he shall
have no vote in chapter or national affairs and shall not take
part in social, athletic, professional or ritual activities of
his chapter.
</li>
<li>A member who is expelled shall be released as prescribed by
these Bylaws.  He shall return his badge, membership card and
membership certificate to the active organization secretary or
national Secretary and shall receive the deposit for the same. 
National Council shall reimburse the chapter or the member
recovering the badge upon receipt of the badge.
</li>
</ol>

### Para. 3 - Voluntary Termination of Membership

<ol type="a">
<li>An active member may seek and obtain a voluntary termination of membership in the Fraternity by submitting a written request to the active organization president. The request for termination shall state the reasons for such a request, but shall not include short-term financial hardship. When possible, the member seeking termination of membership shall be interviewed by at least one member to confirm that the termination would be to the mutual benefit of the member and the Fraternity. It should be understood that termination of membership is intended to be permanent and not a temporary status. The request to terminate membership and supporting information shall be forwarded to the National Headquarters. Upon receipt, the National Secretary (or his designee) shall remove the name of the member from the rolls of the Fraternity.</li>

<li>An alumni, associate, honorary member, or distinguished fellow may seek and obtain a voluntary termination of membership in the Fraternity by submitting a written request to the National Headquarters. The request for termination shall state the reasons for such a request. Voluntary termination may be granted when the termination would be to the mutual benefit of the member and the Fraternity or the member has lost all interest in the Fraternity. Upon receipt of the request and the determination that the member has lost all interest in the Fraternity, the National Secretary (or his designee) shall remove the name of the member from the rolls of the Fraternity.</li>
<li>A member who is voluntarily terminated shall cease all fraternal activities of TRIANGLE; he shall have no vote and shall not take part in social, athletic, professional or ritual activities of the Fraternity. He shall return his badge, membership card and membership certificate to the active organization secretary or National Headquarters.</li>
</ol>

### Para. 4 - Release of a Member or Candidate

<ol type="a">
<li>The Release Oath shall be administered by the president of
the active organization for candidates and active members and by the
president of the alumni organization or a representative
designated by National Council for other members.  Whenever
possible, the release oath shall be administered in the presence
of at least two members as witnesses.
</li>
<li>In case the candidate or member to be released has left the
chapter and a personal meeting cannot be arranged, the president
shall forward, by certified mail, a copy of the Release Oath,
requesting the person to affirm the Release Oath by signing it
and returning it by mail.
</li>
<li>Every release, whether in the case of a candidate or of a
member, shall be recorded with the Secretary and a statement of
the details of the case shall be filed with the Secretary.
</li>
<li>If for any reason, a member or candidate is to be released, the
following Release Oath shall be administered:
<blockquote>
"I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will in no way make
intelligible to others any of the secrets of TRIANGLE that are
known to me.  I will never express myself in any way so as to
defame the name of TRIANGLE or any of its members."
</blockquote>
</li>

</ol>

### Para. 5 - Reinstatement of Members.

<ol type="a">
<li>A suspended member shall be reinstated when his period of
suspension has elapsed or by a majority vote at any regular

for reinstatement.  Such reinstatement may be granted
only upon the three-fourths (3/4) favorable vote by the applicable body
 at the next regular meeting of that body.
</li>
<li>An active member who has been voluntarily terminated may
petition, in writing, the active organization for reinstatement.
