## SECTION 7 - CHAPTER ETERNAL CEREMONY

### Para. 1

The Chapter Eternal Ceremony of TRIANGLE is a guide for celebrating the life of a
TRIANGLE brother who has entered Chapter Eternal. People and cultures are different
throughout TRIANGLE, therefore the ceremony is a template to be adapted to the
individual's beliefs and desires and not be held to by strict ritual premise. It is an open
ceremony in order to allow friends and family to be present with their loved one.

### Para. 2

The Chapter Eternal Ceremony of TRIANGLE is as follows:

<blockquote>
<p>"It is my privilege on behalf of Triangle Fraternity to reflect and honor the passing of:</p>

<p>"Brother ____________________    Chapter/year: ________________</p>

<p>"Triangle brothers are joined by our studies in Engineering or Architecture or Science. And while some move into other fields, we joined Triangle because of our initial interest and desire to bond with friends of common pursuits.</p>

<p>"Our fraternity encourages each brother to be a companion of the sincerest good will, demonstrating firmness of purpose and strong, deep-rooted dependability.</p>

<p>"When a brother passes, Triangle records his passing into the fraternity's Chapter Eternal, where he joins with fellow brothers who have preceded him.</p>

<p>"Brother __________________, you have entered the silent domain that all the dead have reached, and where the journey of every worldly life ends.</p>

<p>"And we&mdash;your brothers, your friends, and your family&mdash;meet to do the last kind act that a brother may do for his fellow brother. To reflect on your life, to remember your virtues, to speak with tenderness, and shed tears for your ashes in your sacred place of rest and peace. Veritas Omnia Vincit. Truth Conquers All."</p>
</blockquote>
