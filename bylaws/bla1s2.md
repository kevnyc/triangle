# ARTICLE 1 - MEMBERSHIP

## SECTION 2 - ALUMNI MEMBERS

### Para. 1

An active member shall become an alumni member upon graduating
from  or leaving the technical institution at which he held
active membership in a TRIANGLE chapter.

### Para. 2

An active member may choose to become an alumni member if:

<ol type="i">
<li>he has been an active member for at least four (4) years, and</li>
<li>he has been enrolled as a regular student for at least four
(4) years.</li>
</ol>

In extraordinary circumstances, National Council may waive these 
requirements and allow an individual memberâ€™s change in status 
after consultation with the active organization president and secretary.

An active member who chooses to become an alumni member shall
inform the secretary of the active organization in writing.  The
member's change in status from active to alumni member shall be
effective with the beginning of the next regular school term.

### Para. 3

Alumni members are encouraged to visit and participate in the
activities of TRIANGLE chapters other than the one in which they
held active membership.  Nothing in the National Constitution or
these Bylaws shall be construed to discourage such visitation and
participation. Subject to the provisions of chapter constitutions
and bylaws, alumni members may attend meetings, hold elective
offices and attend National Conventions as voting delegates of
any chapter.

### Para. 4

A chapter may, in its constitution and bylaws, create and provide
for special designations for alumni members of other chapters for
whom the chapter has developed a special affinity or affection,
based upon the alumni member's service to or participation in the
affairs of the chapter. Such designations shall be subject to the
prior approval of National Council.
