The following resolution was adopted by the 2005 National
Convention and subsequently modified by National Council:

<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREAS Triangle Fraternity wants every opportunity to expand to all eligible campuses; and</p>

<p>"WHEREAS Triangle Fraternity recognizes and supports the position of the North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC), which promotes that we must extend good will and like opportunities to NIC members if we are to expect like good will and opportunities in return; and</p>

<p>"WHEREAS Triangle Fraternity upholds its Code of Ethics by promoting
the Fraternal Movement which upholds the traditions and programs of
alma maters and promotes the welfare of all professions, now
therefore be it</p>

<p>"RESOLVED that Triangle Fraternity's chapters and members are expected
to support expansion of any NIC member group to their campuses; be it also</p>

<p>"RESOLVED that Triangle Fraternity's chapters and its representatives
are expected to support any NIC member group's application for
membership to their campus's Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) or like
organization, where we have a vote in that process; and be it also</p>

<p>"RESOLVED that Triangle Fraternity expects all NIC members and their
chapters, representatives and members to support any expansion
efforts of Triangle to their campuses (including membership in any IFC or like organization)."</p>
