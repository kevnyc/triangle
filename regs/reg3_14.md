# Fraternity Regulation 3.14 (Revised)

## POSITION STATEMENTS / University Relations Policy

Revised March 11, 2018

<strong>
3.14.1.
</strong>
The Triangle Code of Ethics states that each member shall "uphold faithfully the traditions and program of [his] alma mater." As a collection of members, each chapter is also expected to follow this course in its relationship and interactions with its host institution.

Therefore, each chapter and its members shall:

<ol type="a">
<li>Be a properly recognized student organization in accordance with the regulations set forth by its host institution and/or...</li>
<li>Be a member in good standing of its Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) or like organization, and take an active part in university activities available to fraternities.</li>
<li>Obey student codes of conduct as well as all university regulations applying to Greek organizations and student organizations.</li>
</ol>

In the rare situation that a university policy is deemed contrary to the ideals of Triangle or the rights of its members, any of the above requirements may be waived on a case-by-case basis by a majority vote of National Council. If a chapter and its members are not able to fulfill any of the above requirements, because of a refusal to sign a recognition, relationship, or similar document indemnifying the institution against its own negligence, or if it is determined that membership in the campus IFC is a barrier to success, then National Council can waive any of these requirements. (See Regulation 3.15 for additional information.)
