# Fraternity Regulation 2.5 (Revised)

## NATIONAL AFFAIRS / Approved Courses Committee

Revised October 10, 2014


<strong>
2.5.1.
</strong>
Pursuant to National Bylaws Article 1, Section 1, Para. 1a, National Council hereby establishes procedures for the appointment and operation of the Approved Courses Committee  provided for in the above-referenced Bylaw.

<strong>
2.5.2.
</strong>
National Council shall appoint an Approved Courses Committee consisting of no fewer than two (2) and no more than four (4) members or non-members of Triangle. The number of Triangle members on the committee shall be greater than or equal to the number of non-members on the committee. Each member of the Committee shall be appointed for a term of up to three years.

<strong>
2.5.3.
</strong>
At least two members of the Committee should have a minimum of five years academic administrative experience (Department Head, Assistant Dean or higher) in higher education.  All members shall have demonstrated a continuing interest in the Fraternity prior to their appointment.

<strong>
2.5.4.
</strong>
National Council shall designate one of the Committee members to serve as Chairman. Removal of a member from the chairmanship shall not otherwise affect his tenure as a member of the Committee.

<strong>
2.5.5.
</strong>
National Council may remove a member of the Committee from his position, with or without cause.

<strong>
2.5.6.
</strong>
The Committee shall perform the following tasks as required:

<ol type="a">
<li>Consider requests received from chapters, colonies and interest groups of Triangle for the establishment or revision of lists of courses of study approved for Triangle membership at such chapters, colonies and interest groups;
</li>
<li>Approve or decline such requests according to the criteria provided in Fraternity Regulation 2.6;
</li>
<li>Assure a consistency in approved courses listings for the chapters, colonies and interest groups, such that comparable courses of study are either uniformly approved or disapproved.
</li>
</ol>

<strong>
2.5.7.
</strong>
The Committee shall have the authority to examine or re-examine any course of study at any college or university at which Triangle is represented or proposes to be represented, and may specify a limitation (not less than three nor more than seven years) on the term for which approval of any course of study shall continue without the necessity for resubmission. The Committee is further authorized to establish a schedule of approval expiration dates for courses of study previously approved, such that its workload will remain relatively balanced from year to year.

<strong>
2.5.8.
</strong>
National Council reserves the power conferred upon it by the National Bylaws to revise or repeal these rules at any time, and to direct the Committee as to the philosophy with which it is to approach its duties. Absent any direction to the contrary, the provisions of Regulation 2.6 describing criteria for approval of courses of study shall be construed with a view toward rejection in cases of uncertainty.
