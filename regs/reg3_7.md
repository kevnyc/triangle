# Fraternity Regulation 3.7 (Revised)

## POSITION STATEMENTS / Liability Insurance

Revised February 18, 2018

<strong>
3.7.1.
</strong>
National Council has been informed that in the event of an
incident involving one of the chapters or colonies of Triangle,
there is a strong likelihood that any resulting litigation would
also involve the National Organization.  If a chapter or colony
fails to carry proper liability insurance, the entire assets of
the National Organization and the Fraternity itself could be
placed at risk.

<strong>
3.7.2.
</strong>
National Council has determined, in the exercise of its fiduciary
responsibility to protect and preserve Triangle and its assets,
that Triangle can no longer allow any chapter or colony to
jeopardize the entire Fraternity by its failure or refusal to
carry adequate liability insurance.

<strong>
3.7.3.
</strong>
Each chapter and colony shall, not later than September 15, 1998, obtain liability insurance through Triangle Fraternity's National Insurance Program.
