## POSITION STATEMENTS / Chapter Payments to National Council

Effective August 6, 1996

<strong>
3.9.1.
</strong>
Under the National Bylaws, National Council has the power to
suspend chapters and active organizations.  Under the National
Bylaws, National Council also has the power to recognize (and
inherently to withdraw recognition from) colonies and interest
groups.

<strong>
3.9.2.
</strong>
National Council has grown increasingly concerned over the
failure of some chapters to pay their obligations to National
Council in a timely manner.  While National Council recognizes
that all chapter accounts payable to National Council are subject
to a late charge of 1.5% per month, it appears to National
Council that these late charges have failed to induce some
chapters to assign appropriate priority to the payment of their
obligations to National Council.

<strong>
3.9.3.
</strong>
Beginning with the 1996-97 academic year, any chapter having an
outstanding balance due National Council in excess of twenty
percent (20%) of its predicted annual national fees (National
Active Fees, Pledge Fees, Initiation Fees and National Meeting
Reserve fees) for more than sixty days will be subject to the
following sanctions:

<ol type="a">
<li>At sixty days, eligibility to participate in any national
awards programs shall be suspended.  Such programs shall be
deemed to include Chapter Performance Award, Summit Award,
Scholarship awards, Publication awards, and individual awards
such as Triangle Fraternity Education Foundation loans and
scholarships.
</li>
<li>At ninety days, the chapter, colony or interest group shall
be placed on probation and permission to initiate new members
shall be withheld or withdrawn.  In order for the probation to be
lifted, the chapter shall be required to pay the entire balance
due National Council and submit a current balance sheet, and aged
accounts receivable and accounts payable reports.
</li>
<li>At one hundred twenty days, the National Treasurer shall
refer the chapter's status to National Council with a
recommendation on suspension of the active organization.
</li>
</ol>

<strong>
3.9.4.
</strong>
The amount of predicted annual national fees for each chapter
shall be determined by multiplying the total number of active
members and pledges as shown by the National Secretary's records
as of the end of June of each year by $100.00.
