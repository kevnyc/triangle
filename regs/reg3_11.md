# Fraternity Regulation 3.11 (Original)

## POSITION STATEMENTS / Little Sisters

Effective February 22, 2004

<strong>
3.11.1.
</strong>
The following resolution was adopted by the 2003 National
Convention:

<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREAS, Triangle Fraternity believes that sororities and women's fraternities offer excellent opportunities for women to share a fraternal experience; and</p>

<p>"WHEREAS, Triangle Fraternity, as a social fraternity, is specifically exempt from the provisions of Title IX; and</p>

<p>"WHEREAS, auxiliary women's groups organized by men's fraternity chapters, commonly referred to as 'little sisters,' are inconsistent with the concept and philosophy of separate and equal women's fraternities; and</p>

<p>"WHEREAS, Triangle Fraternity believes that these groups inhibit the accomplishment of chapter goals by:</p>
<ul>
<li>DIVERTING resources of time, efforts, and money which are needed for chapter operations and programming;</li>
<li>DISTRACTING chapter members in the performance of essential duties (e.g., membership recruitment and membership education);</li>
<li>INVITING disharmony within the chapter by usurping the roles and responsibilities of initiated members; and</li>
<li>WEAKENING the bonds of brotherhood by adversely affecting interpersonal relationships within the chapter; and</li>
</ul>

<p>"WHEREAS, the North-American Interfraternity Council, the Fraternity Executives Association, and several member fraternities have taken a position against these auxiliary groups;</p>

<p>"THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that Triangle Fraternity hereby states its position on 'little sisters' as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The formation of new 'little sister' groups is prohibited;</li>
<li>Chapters having 'little sister' groups are to eliminate these groups by the end of the 2003-2004 academic year."</li>
</ul>
