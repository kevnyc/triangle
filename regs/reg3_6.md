## POSITION STATEMENTS / Triangle Risk Management Policy

Revised August 13, 2023

<strong>TRIANGLE FRATERNITY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY</strong>

The goal of Triangle Fraternity is to develop balanced men in the fields of Engineering, Architecture and Science.  We aim to do that by providing an environment that fosters personal growth and professional success.  This includes taking an interest in the personal well-being of each of our members.

Triangle Fraternity expects its members to properly respect and follow the laws and regulations governing the chapters and individual members, create an environment of responsibility, and to live the Triangle Code of Ethics.

The Risk Management Policy of Triangle Fraternity includes the provisions which follow and shall apply to all fraternity entities and all levels of fraternity membership.

<strong>3.6.1 ALCOHOL AND DRUGS</strong>

In any activity sponsored or endorsed by any Triangle chapter or at any event that a reasonable, objective observer would associate with a chapter, including those that occur on or off chapter premises:

1. Chapters, members, and guests must comply with all federal, state, provincial, and local laws.  No person under the legal drinking age may possess, consume, provide, or be provided alcoholic beverages.
1. Chapters, members, and guests must follow the federal law regarding illegal drugs and controlled substances.  No person may possess, use, provide, distribute, sell, and/or manufacture illegal drugs or other controlled substances while at any chapter premises or at any activity or event sponsored or endorsed by the chapter.
1. Alcoholic beverages must either be: (a) provided and sold on a per-drink basis by a licensed and insured third-party vendor (e.g., restaurant, bar, caterer, etc.); or (b) brought by individual members and guests through a bring your own beverage ("BYOB") system. The presence of alcohol products above 15% alcohol by volume (ABV) is prohibited on any chapter premises or at any event, except when served by a licensed and insured third-party vendor.
1. Common sources of alcohol, including bulk quantities, which are not being served by a licensed, insured third-party vendor, are prohibited (i.e., amounts of alcohol greater than what a reasonable person should consume over the duration of an event).
1. Alcoholic beverages must not be purchased with chapter funds or funds pooled by members or guests (e.g. admission fees, cover fees, collecting funds through digital apps, etc.).
1. A chapter must not co-host or co-sponsor, or in any way participate in, an activity or event with another group or entity that purchases or provides alcohol.
1. A chapter must not co-host or co-sponsor an event with a bar, event promoter or alcohol distributor; however, a chapter may rent a bar, restaurant, or other licensed and insured third-party vendor to host a chapter event.
1. Attendance by non-members at any event where alcohol is present must be by invitation only, and the chapter must utilize a guest list system.  Attendance at events with alcohol is limited to a 3:1 maximum guest-to-member ratio and must not exceed local fire or building code capacity of the chapter premises or event venue.
1. Any event or activity related to the new member joining process (e.g., recruitment, intake, rush, etc.) must be substance free. No alcohol or drugs may be present if the event or activity is related to new member activities, meetings, or initiation into an organization, including but not limited to "bid night," "big/little" events or activities, "family" events or activities, and any ritual or ceremony.
1. Chapters, members or guests must not permit, encourage, coerce, glorify or participate in any activities involving the rapid consumption of alcohol, such as drinking games.

<strong>3.6.2 HAZING</strong>

1. Be coerced to violate federal, state, provincial, local law, or Triangle policy.
1. Be coerced to consume any food, liquid, alcoholic liquid, drug, or other substance in any non-customary manner which subjects the individual or group of individuals to a substantial risk of emotional or physical harm which includes but not limited to sickness, vomiting, intoxication, or unconsciousness.

<strong>3.6.3 SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT</strong>

The fraternity and chapters should not tolerate or condone any form of sexist or sexually abusive behavior on the part of its members, whether physical, mental or emotional. This is to include any actions, activities or events, whether on chapter premises or an off-site location, which are demeaning to women or men, including but not limited to verbal harassment or sexual assault by individuals or members acting together. The employment or use of strippers, exotic dancers or similar, whether professional or amateur, at a fraternity event as defined in this policy should not be allowed.

<strong>3.6.4 RESPECT AND DIGNITY</strong>

Triangle expects its organizations, members and guests to respect the dignity of all persons.

Abusive, harassing or discriminatory behavior towards others is prohibited.

<strong>3.6.5 FIGHTING AND PHYSICAL ABUSE</strong>

The fraternity will not tolerate or condone any form of fighting or physically abusive behavior while on chapter premises or during a fraternity event, in any situation sponsored or endorsed by the chapter, or at any event a reasonable observer would associate with the fraternity.

Chapter houses must meet all applicable fire and health codes and standards.  Chapters should also comply with any recommendations as reported by the Fraternity's insurance company or municipal authorities.

<strong>3.6.7	FIREARMS, EXPLOSIVE OR INCENDIARY DEVICES</strong>

Triangle and its members must comply with all federal, state, provincial, local laws and campus policy as it relates to firearms or explosive or incendiary devices.

<strong>3.6.9	HIGH-RISK EVENTS</strong>

Potentially risky events are specifically prohibited unless permission is obtained from the National Headquarters. These events can include mud bowls, boxing, wrestling, or other physical combat activities. Additionally, Triangle chapters shall not sponsor high-risk events with mechanical bulls, bungee jumping, sky diving, parachute jumping, bouncy houses, or similar activities. Any projectile propulsion devices, even apparently safe things like water balloon launchers, can be dangerous if misused. Three-person slingshots, crossbows, and potato guns are expressly forbidden within the confines and premises of the chapter house or at Triangle events. The negligent use of other forms of projectile propulsion devices, particularly any such use that potentially causes damage or injury, shall be treated as a violation of this risk management policy.
Chapter leaders must recognize that these prohibited events do not constitute an exhaustive list of activities to be avoided. Chapters must take a common-sense approach to evaluating the risk of any events or activities. Should there be any doubt about a particular activity or event, chapter leaders should contact the National Headquarters.

<strong>3.6.10	RETALIATION</strong>

Triangle prohibits retaliation against any individual &mdash; members and non-members &mdash; for reporting, inquiring, or cooperating with a report around a violation of the Triangle Risk Management Policy.

<strong>3.6.11	EDUCATION</strong>

All student members shall be informed of the Risk Management Policy of Triangle Fraternity annually.  A copy of the Risk Management Policy is also available on the Fraternity's website.
