# Fraternity Regulation 3.1 (Original)

## POSITION STATEMENTS / Responsibilities of Members

Effective August 7, 1973

<strong>3.1.1.</strong> TRIANGLE, by resolution of National Council, endorses and
subscribes to the following resolution setting out the
responsibilities of Fraternity members:

<strong>
RESOLUTION ON RESPONSIBILITIES OF FRATERNITY MEMBERS ADOPTED AT
THE 1963 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COLLEGE FRATERNITY SECRETARIES
ASSOCIATION (now the Fraternity Executives' Association)
</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>WHEREAS, It is apparent that many fraternity chapters do not make
it clear to their rushees just what their individual
responsibilities are in relation to their respective chapters,
and as a result such rushees fail to fulfill those
responsibilities, especially when they become upperclassmen, now,
therefore, be it</p>

<p>RESOLVED, That all member fraternities be provided with the
following statement of responsibilities, and that each
fraternity, either through its magazine columns or a release to
chapters from each central office, urge their chapters to impress
continuously upon their members and especially their rushees
these responsibilities:
</p>
<p>
Complete financial, moral and academic support by every member
for four years, or until such members have received a degree,
including
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Residing in and eating all meals in the chapter if vacancies
exist;
</li>
<li>Attending all chapter meetings and official functions unless
prevented from doing so because of circumstances beyond the
member's control;
</li>
<li>Compliance with all policies and regulations, set forth by
the college and the national fraternity, including those relating
to hazing, drinking and general behavior, and, be it further
</li>
</ol>
<p>RESOLVED, That this statement of responsibility be disseminated
to interfraternity councils, for use in their general fraternity
brochures, should they desire to use it.
</p>
