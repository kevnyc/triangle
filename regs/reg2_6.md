<strong>
2.6.2. Engineering
</strong>

<ol type="a">
<li>Undergraduate engineering programs which are accredited by
the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) shall
be deemed presumptively qualified for approval, and shall not
require further study by the Committee.</li>

<li>Undergraduate four-year engineering technology programs which
are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC)
of ABET, and which are offered at an institution which also
offers EAC of ABET accredited engineering programs, shall be
deemed presumptively qualified for approval.</li>

<li>Undergraduate engineering programs and/or undergraduate
four-year engineering technology programs which are not ABET
accredited may be considered for approval upon review by the
Committee using ABET guidelines.</li>
</ol>

<strong>

Undergraduate science programs may be considered for approval upon review by the Committee, but shall be limited to:

<ol type="a">
<li>natural sciences (which endeavor to explain or predict nature's phenomena);</li>
<li>formal sciences (which use formal systems to generate knowledge); and</li>
<li>applied sciences (which study the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment).</li>
</ol>
Undergraduate science programs in these fields shall be considered for approval upon review by the Committee if they meet the following criteria:
<ol type="a">
<li>At least fifty (50) percent of the courses required for graduation are in engineering, architecture, or natural, formal, or applied sciences; and</li>
<li>Either the program grants a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree, not a bachelor of arts (B.A.), or the program requires at least one (1) academic year of calculus.</li>
</ol>
Approval shall not be granted to programs in social sciences (which study the social world constructed between humans), including political science, military and naval science, library science, and any auxiliary sciences of history.

<strong>
