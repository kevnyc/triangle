# History of Triangle's Coat of Arms

At the 1915 National Convention, Triangle adopted a design for a coat of arms. It is similar to the current design, without the helmet or mantling. Among other locations, the original Coat of Arms can be found on Rattle I (created in 1922) and on the 25th Anniversary Plaque placed at the Illinois Chapter house in April 1932.

At that same 1932 Convention, the current coat of arms design was adopted, incorporating revisions made (with the assistance of our official jeweler) to conform more closely with the principles of heraldry. The new design was presented to the general membership in the September 1932 issue of Triangle Review.
